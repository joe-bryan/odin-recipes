    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The variations on scrambled eggs are limitless. What will make this recipe your go-to is its simplicity. The focus is on the fundamentals, such as whisking and concerted effort. Well-whisked eggs give it an airy feel that gives it a lot of dimension. Whisking for over 30 seconds is all that is needed.</p>
    <p>Once the eggs hit the pan, people go one way or another. Either they let the eggs sit until all the liquid is gone, or they keep moving and breaking them down until they are quite runny. Our focus here is to be in between, aware of the temperature of the pan, the noise from the cooking oil, and the color of the eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp of butter or oil</li>
        <li>Cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>One at a time, crack the eggs on a flat surface and put the liquid in a mixing bowl. Discard the egg shells.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of kosher salt to the bowl. With a fork or a whisk, whisk the eggs for at least 30 seconds. Make sure to go hit all areas of the liquid. Lots of bubbles in the mixture is a sign that it is ready.</li>
        <li>Heat your non-stick pan to medium heat for about two minutes. Add the butter or oil after.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs to tha pan. Ensure eggs disperse evenly on the surface. What you want to look out for is if the edges of the eggs are starting to solidify. Once they do, you can start to scramble the eggs. If the pan is making too much noise, that is an indicator that you need to scramble much faster as the pan is very hot. As you're scrambling the eggs, you are waiting for the eggs to turn solid while retaining the fluffiness. Too much scrambling will reduce the fluff. Once solid, the burner can be turned off and eggs can be transferred to plate. Leaving the eggs on the heating surface will start to brown them, which you will want to avoid at all costs.</li>
        <li>Crack black pepper over the eggs to taste. </li>
    </ol>
