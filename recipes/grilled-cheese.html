    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Leave it alone. Usually, you say that when you don’t want to provoke something, like a bear. In this case, leaving it alone means the bread develops an incredible crunch that will make your grilled cheese stellar.</p>
    <p>The kind of cheese used also plays an essential factor. It’s hard to beat American, but it lacks a lot of depth many other cheese have. For that, go with a medium to sharp cheddar.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>2 slices of American or cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp of butter</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your pan to medium-high temperature. After two minutes, add the butter.</li>
        <li>After the butter has melted, put down both slices of bread on the pan. Now, we are going to leave alone for at least 3 minutes to develop color and texture. Keep an eye and nose out to make sure the bread is not burning.</li>
        <li>Add a slice of cheese to each bread slice. Watch as the cheese slowly melts.</li>
        <li>After one minute of the cheese melting, its time to turn off the pan and move the bread slices to a cutting board.</li>
        <li>Lightly add dijon mustard to the cheese slices and salt. Crack fresh black pepper as well.</li>
        <li>Stack the slices together and cut the sandwhich diagonally.</li>
    </ol>
