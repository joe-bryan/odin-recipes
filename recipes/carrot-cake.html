    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is hit time and again. What started as my mother-in-law's favorite is slowly mine as well. The way the buttercream melts in your mouth along with the moist cake is a match made in heaven. You will want to continue making this one over and over. </p>
    <p>Time is a friend that you will need a lot of in order to make this cake. Chilling the cakes to stiffen before being frosted can be an overnight process. The frosting process of the cake is also another instance of chilling for some time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 lb of cream cheese</li>
        <li>2 sticks of butter</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>8 medium carrots</li>
        <li>6 oz of pecans</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 ground cloves</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the mixing tool that prefer to use. We recommend a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter and cream cheese, scraping the sides occasionally, until the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Stop the mixing, add the kosher salt and powdered sugar to the mix, and cover the bowl.</li>
        <li>Pulse the mixer to slowly incorporate the sugar. Once incorporated, mix on a medium setting until the frosting is light and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and mix lightly. Frosting is complete and can be put in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Toast the pecans until fragrant for about 8 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Oil lightly the three cake pans, then mix the carrots, buttermilk, fresh ginger, and vanilla in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Two thirds of the pecans will be crushed gently and put aside in a small bowl. The rest will be beat finely into medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, kosher salt, baking soda, ground ginger, and cloves to the medium bowl with the fine pecans. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Mix the eggs, sugar, and brown sugar with your mixing tool. Start on a low speed and slowly increase speed until mixture is like a dissolving ribbon.</li>
        <li>Add neutral oil with the mixing tool at a medium speed. Keep going until the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Add one third of the flour mixture and mix on a low speed. Add half of the carrots until incorporated into the mixture, then add half of the remaining flour. Add remaining carrots and flour and stop mixing when the flour disappears in the mixture. Fold in pecan pieces. </li>
        <li>Divide the batter into the three pans and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and chill the cakes in the refrigerator for at least an hour. The longer they chill, the more flavor that develops.</li>
        <li>Bring one cake out and add frosting to the top layer. Stack a cake on top and add frosting to the top of this cake. Add the last cake on top. Put the cake on the cake stand, and start frosting the sides. Once complete, put the cake back in the refrigerator to chill one more time.</li>
        <li>Take cake out and add another layer of frosting. Ensure that no gaps are left. The cake is ready to be served.</li>
    </ol>
